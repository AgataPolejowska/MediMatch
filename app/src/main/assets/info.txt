MediMatch is a simple game which main purpose is to help people associate medications names with their usage.

Cards matching is accomplished by dragging cards with funcions and dropping them onto the main card with the name of the specific drug.

Proceeding to the next medication can only occur if matching is done perfectly. Otherwise, it is advised to play the game again.

Good Luck!
